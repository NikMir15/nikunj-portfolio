# Portfolio

## Overview
This project showcases a practical software solution built as part of my Cloud & Enterprise Computing journey.  
It focuses on backend development, clean architecture, and real-world problem solving using modern development practices.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Git & GitHub  
- JavaScript (Frontend logic)  
- HTML & CSS  
- Linux (Development environment)  
- Cloud fundamentals (deployment-ready design)

---

## Architecture
The project follows a simple and modular architecture where responsibilities are clearly separated between frontend and backend components.

The design emphasizes:
- Maintainability
- Clear data flow
- Ease of future cloud or container-based deployment

This structure allows the application to scale or be enhanced with cloud-native tools later if required.
