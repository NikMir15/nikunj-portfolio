# Cloud-Based Event Ticket System

## Overview
This project showcases a cloud-ready event ticketing platform built as part of my Cloud & Enterprise Computing journey.  
It focuses on backend development, modular system design, and real-world event and ticket management workflows using modern development practices.

---

## Tech Stack
- Java  
- Modular backend architecture  
- Frontend application module  
- Git & GitHub  
- Linux (Development environment)  
- Cloud-ready design (deployment-ready structure)

---

## Architecture
The project follows a simple and modular architecture where responsibilities are clearly separated between frontend and backend components.

The design emphasizes:
- Maintainability  
- Clear data flow  
- Scalability and future cloud deployment  

This structure allows the system to scale or be enhanced with containerization and cloud-native tools later if required.
